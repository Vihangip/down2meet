## Project Description
Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. Who is it for? What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?) 
> This app is for a group of people who often need to select a meeting time when all members of the group are available. This will enable them to automatically see which day will be ideal for a meet-up without having to have a prolonged conversation and sequentially go through all potential dates.

>There will be ...
> - An events tab that has your confirmed hangouts.
> - A feed that has everyone’s availability, where you can filter by day/time etc. 
> - A "Hang Now" tab, where you can request and see immediate meet-up requests

What type of data will it store? 
> - User accounts 
> - Schedules 
> - Activities

What will users be able to do with this data? 
> Users can friend other users, and choose who can see their meet-up requests and schedule (ie. family, close friends)
> Users can see their own schedule and friends’ schedules
> Users can see their planned activities and friends' activities

What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints? 
> Include the option to select professional or casual mode (work  v.s. fun mode)

## Project task requirements
3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
> - Create account (set up profile)
> - Log into account
> - Add/remove friend 
> - Share availability 
> - View planned activities
> - Request/confirm a hangout

3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete) 
> - Filter friends based on availability
> - System saves the user’s default schedule times (fixed schedule ie. work hours) 
> - System announcement of the availability and meet-up requests
> - Create friend group, User can select who/which group gets shown their availability

2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1!)
> - Allowing user to upload/update their schedule
> - Using an API to upload their schedule from UBC, Google Calendar, etc. 
> - Sync events committed on the App to the user’s personal Google account (Google token for sign up may help with it); schedule changes made on the app would be reflected on their Google Calendar
> - Request meeting change -> WILL MEET (Can do so by chatting with the system and having it broadcast the request to the other members of the group)
> - Change language of the whole webapp (User can select the language of the webapp)
> - Log into different accounts, Select which account(s) to display schedule from (ie. work account, personal account)

Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks! 
> Share availability 
> - User inputs their schedule 
> - User uploads their schedule
> - The user's friends are able to see their schedule
> Request/confirm a hangout
> - User requests a meet-up with friends
> - Their friends confirm the meet-up
> - Users involved can record details of the hangout/activities
> - User can view details of their confirmed plan (data/time, activities)

Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.
